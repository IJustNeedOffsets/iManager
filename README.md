# iManager
Open Sourced application for Jailbroken device. Program is executing commands on connected iphones


## THE README WILL BE REWRITTEN IN THE NEXT!! Im CURRENTLY recoding iManager
i removed the releases because both wasnt really stable and user told me some issues that they had. As i said above im currently working on it to fix those issues and release a more stable build. (Im also going to update the soruce code) I habe to apologize for creating a reddit post about this too fast and i should have tested it way more then i did.

# Usage
Maybe the source code is helping ppl who need to execute commands from a pc/mac on a jailbroken device? Also it teaches some ios commands and installs
basic command-line-tools like appinst and sbutils. 
You donÂ´t need to run any command from terminal, just launch the application and everything should work. (READ THE INSTALL PART!!!)
demo/using video: https://youtu.be/wNHSVi1AC8c (the UI changed a bit but at all its still kinda similar

# soon

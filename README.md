# iManager
Open Sourced application for Jailbroken device. Program is executing commands on connected iphones


## THE README WILL BE REWRITTEN TODAY OR TOMORROW!! I recoded iManager
You can download the recoded version (version 1.1) from the releases already. I also uploaded the recoded source code here, but the installation and compiling ways changed.

# Usage
Maybe the source code is helping ppl who need to execute commands from a pc/mac on a jailbroken device? Also it teaches some ios commands and installs
basic command-line-tools like appinst and sbutils. 
You donÂ´t need to run any command from terminal, just launch iManager.app and everything should work. (READ THE INSTALL PART!!!)
#Cureent Features:
sbreload, install deb, shutdown, install ipa, install command line tools, uicache, respring, ldrestart and send files to your iphone.


# Supported
all ios version that support ssh will work with that code in theory

## I will rewrite the Installation and Compiling part at night or tomorrow. (I somehow recoded iManager bc people had issues with it. Sorry for not testing it on other macs.)

## Planned to be added in the future:
-Installing tweaks system, and package manager after jailbreaking with checkra1n
-Making a modified version of Sileo and adding an option to install it
